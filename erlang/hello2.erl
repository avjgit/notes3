-module(hello2).
% but modules cannot have variables!
% only functions can have them, but,
% once defined, they cannot be re-assigned:
% "that would imply that the function has a state, which itdoes not"

% bracket is a list - dynamic array
% Functions must be exported before they can be called from outside the module where they are defined.
-export([hello_world/0]).

% it's like a method
hello_world() -> io:fwrite("hello, world\n").

% stringsare really just lists of integers

% A tuple is like a list, except you generally donâ€™tgrow or shrink it

% todo: ask why "syntax error before: '->'"

% tupes - used to store fixed number of items
