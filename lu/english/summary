        mutation/ random
        sexual recombination
    selection
        living things adapt

    "all of an organism's inherited characteristics are in single messenger molecule: DNA"

    simple, linear, 4-element code

    genotype -> phenotype



    evolution came as inspiration to a group of researches to design algorithms
